# Todo Application - Node.js, Express, MongoDB


Input validation handled with joi. Fetch API handling our http requests from user. Bootstrap handling alerts, buttons, forms. Jquery used to obtain some of the DOM elements. 

## Database
We are using a local instance of a MongoDB database, running on port 27017. To communicate to the database we are simply sending query strings...as opposed to something like Mongoose or a more robust Object mapper.

## Build and Testing
First start your local mongo DB running the following command

command: mongod

Run the following command from the root folder of your project

command: node app
